## 🔧 Technologies choice

Project developed using the React library to make it a Single Page Application, which guarantees the best performance when running directly in the client's browser, Create React Application tool to configure the environment, TypeScript as the language to guarantee props and state values accordingly as expected from the contract, JSONWebToken as the token handler stored in the Local Storage, which allows user to access the application with no need to login one more time, Redux as the global context state management, Styled Components to avoid unnecessary and conflicting component styles, Testing Library and Jest for testing to ensure quality assurance on components and events, Atomic Design as the design pattern to promote clean maintenance and good coding practices according to ESLint and EditorConfig.

 ## 🎆 Redux

  Redux was used to guarantee the data from user's GitHub on every component, save the token, login and logout the user.

  On the Login page by checking 'Save login', you choose to store the token in Local Storage. In Redux Initial State we get the token from Local Storage, if it doesn't exist you can login again or for the first time, once private routes checks the token directly from Redux.

 `
  InitialState = {
    token: ${localStorage.getItem()},
    user: {
      githubUserImage: `https://github.com/${githubUser}.png`,
      githubUser,
    },
  }
 `

You can access the redux actions on folder `src/store/actions`.
